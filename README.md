# React Native Web + Mobile Template

## ✨ Intro

This repo combines **React Native** and **React Native Web** into a single project. It's a basic scaffolding providing developers with a ready to use Android, iOS and Web app.

## 🤔 Why?

To save hours and possibly days of developer effort by providing an already solution to combine both **React Native** and **React Native Web** into a single solution.

## 🎁 What's inside?

It's a pretty simple template 🙂. You get what you'll get when creating a React Native project with `npx react-native init projectName` and a React project with `create-react-app`.

## 🔻 How to use it

- Clone the repo.
- Run `npm install` inside it.
- `cd ios` then `pod install` on macOS.
- `npm run start` then `npm run android` or `npm run ios`.
